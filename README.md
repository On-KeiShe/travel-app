# ✈️ Travel Organiser App

A React-based travel organiser app built as a **learning-focused project** to practise front-end fundamentals while building something genuinely useful and thoughtfully designed by creating a calm, user-friendly interface.

This project focuses on **learning by doing**, keeping features intentionally simple and approachable in a step by step manner.

Th aim of this project was built a **learning-focused React project**, with an emphasis on:

- strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals
- practise breaking problems into smaller steps
- build confidence working with state and APIs
- write readable, beginner-friendly code

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me practise and better understand:

- React components and JSX
- `useState` and controlled inputs
- Conditional rendering based on state
- Handling form submissions and user inputs
- Fetching data from APIs
- Separating logic into utility files
- Styling components consistently across an app
- Debugging issues step by step (including Git and deployment challenges)

Most importantly, this project helped me slow down, reason through problems, and understand **why** things work — not just how to make them work.

## 🔮 Future Learnings & Improvements

This project is intentionally simple, but designed with clear opportunities for growth in the future:

### ⏰ Holiday Countdown
- Extend the countdown to include **hours, minutes, and seconds**
- Introduce live updates using timers

### 🌤️ Weather
- Visually display weather information in a more engaging way
- Use icons, layout, and colour to make forecasts easier to understand at a glance

### 💌 Virtual Postcard
- Allow users to upload their own photos
- Build a backend to support **saving and sharing postcards**

These improvements will be explored as part of continued learning.
